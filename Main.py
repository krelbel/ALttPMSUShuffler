# Creates a shuffled MSU-1 pack for ALttP Randomizer from one or more source
# MSU-1 packs.
#
# Usage:
#
# 1) Copy this script to a new subdirectory in the directory containing all
#    of your current MSU packs
#
# 2) Copy the ALttP Randomizer ROM (with background music enabled) to this
#    directory.  The script will rename it to "shuffled.sfc".  The original name
#    is printed to "output.log" (handy for retrieving spoilers).  If you don't
#    copy the ROM before running the script, you need to rename the ROM to
#    "shuffled.sfc" yourself.  The script will warn before overwriting
#    "shuffled.sfc" if it already exists.
#
# 2) Run Main.py to execute the script to delete any old pack in this directory
#    and generate a new one.  Track names picked will be saved in "output.log"
#    (cleared on reruns)
#
# 3) Load "shuffled.sfc" in an MSU-compatible emulator (works well with
#    Snes9x 1.60)
#
# Additional options/usage notes:
#
# - By default, the generated pack will pick each track from a matching
#   track number in a random MSU pack in the parent directory of this
#   script.  For dungeon-specific or boss-specific tracks, if the random
#   pack chosen isn't an extended MSU pack, the generic dungeon/boss music
#   is chosen instead.
#
#   Note that if you ONLY have non-extended packs, this
#   default behavior will create an extended pack, which (like all extended
#   packs) prevents you from using music cues to distinguish pendant from
#   crystal dungeons.  If you want this, use --basicshuffle instead.
#
# - If run in the command line as "python Main.py --basicshuffle", each
#   track is chosen from the same track from a random pack.  If you have any
#   extended packs, the dungeon/boss themes from non-extended packs will
#   never be chosen.
#
# - If run in the command line as "python Main.py --fullshuffle", behavior
#   for non-looping tracks (short fanfares, portals, etc.) remains as
#   default, but looping tracks will be in shuffled order, so each track
#   in the generated pack is chosen from a random track number in a random
#   MSU pack.  Pick this if you like shop music in Ganon's Tower.
#
# - If run in the command line as
#   "python Main.py --singleshuffle ../your-msu-pack-name-here", behavior is
#   the same as with --fullshuffle, but a single MSU pack of your choice is
#   chosen as the shuffled source for all tracks in the generated pack.
#
#  Debugging options (not necessary for normal use):
#
# - This script uses hardlinks instead of copies by default to reduce disk
#   usage and increase speed; the --realcopy option can be used to create
#   real copies instead of hardlinks.
#
# - The --dry-run option can be used to make this script print the filesystem
#   commands (deleting, creating, renaming files) it would have executed
#   instead of executing them.

#Since the presence of any dungeon/boss-specific track from an extended MSU
#pack overrides the generic pendant/crystal dungeon or generic boss music,
#a basic shuffle always picking track N as that same track N from a random
#pack will result in no boss/dungeon music from a non-extended pack ever
#being chosen if the user has a single extended pack.
#
#To allow dungeon/boss music to be played, the dungeon/boss-specific
#extended MSU tracks are shuffled differently; for each extended
#dungeon/boss-specific track, a pack is chosen randomly, then its
#corresponding dungeon/boss-specific track is chosen if present,
#otherwise, the generic dungeon/boss music from that pack is chosen.
#
#This means that a user that ONLY has non-extended packs won't be able to
#listen to dungeon music to determine crystal/pendant status in modes where
#that applies (since EP/DP/TH would always play light world music from a
#random pack regardless of pendant/crystal status).  To preserve that
#behavior, --basicshuffle can be used.
