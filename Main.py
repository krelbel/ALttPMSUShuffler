# Creates a shuffled MSU-1 pack for ALttP Randomizer from one or more source
# MSU-1 packs.
#
# Usage:
#
# 1) Copy this script to a new subdirectory in the directory containing all
#    of your current MSU packs.  For example, if your MSU pack is in
#    `"MSUs\alttp_undertale\alttp_msu-1.pcm"`, the script should be in
#    `"MSUs\ALttPMSUShuffler\Main.py"`.
#
# 2) DRAG AND DROP METHOD:
#
#     1) Drag one or more ALttP Randomizer ROMs (with background music enabled)
#        on top of Main.py to open the ROMs with the python script; for each ROM
#        opened this way, a shuffled MSU pack matching that ROM's name will be
#        generated next to the ROM in its original directory (with the tracklist
#        in ROMNAME-msushuffleroutput.log).
#
# 3) MANUAL METHOD:
#
#     1) Copy the ALttP Randomizer ROM (with background music enabled) to the
#        same directory as this Main.py script.  The script will rename the ROM
#        to "shuffled.sfc".  The original ROM name and tracklist is printed to
#        "shuffled-msushuffleroutput.log" (handy for retrieving spoilers).  If
#        you don't copy the ROM before running the script, you need to rename
#        the ROM to "shuffled.sfc" yourself.  The script will warn before
#        overwriting "shuffled.sfc" if it already exists.
#
#     2) Run **Main.py** to execute the script to delete any old pack in this
#        directory and generate a new one.  Track names picked will be saved in
#        "shuffled-msushuffleroutput.log" (cleared on reruns)
#
#     3) LIVE RESHUFFLE METHOD: Instead of simply running 
#        **Main.py**, run **LiveReshuffle.py** or run in the command line as
#        "python Main.py --live 10" (or any other positive integer) to
#        generate a new shuffled MSU pack every few seconds.  Will skip
#        replacing any tracks currently being played.  Best if used without
#        the --realcopy option, and best if the shuffled MSU pack and source
#        packs are all on the same hard drive, to avoid excessive disk usage.
#        Edit **LiveReshuffle.py** to set a different reshuffle interval than
#        the 10 second default.
#
#     4) LIVE RESHUFFLE + NOW PLAYING VIEW (EXPERIMENTAL): Run the command
#        line as "python Main.py --live 10 --nowplaying" to run in live
#        reshuffle mode (as described above) while polling qusb2snes for
#        the currently playing MSU pack, printed to console and nowplaying.txt
#        for use as an OBS streaming text source.
#
# 4) Load the ROM in an MSU-compatible emulator (works well with Snes9x 1.60)
#
# Additional options/usage notes:
#
# - By default, the generated pack will pick each track from a matching
#   track number in a random MSU pack in the parent directory of this
#   script.  For dungeon-specific or boss-specific tracks, if the random
#   pack chosen isn't an extended MSU pack, the generic dungeon/boss music
#   is chosen instead.
#
#   Note that if you ONLY have non-extended packs, this
#   default behavior will create an extended pack, which (like all extended
#   packs) prevents you from using music cues to distinguish pendant from
#   crystal dungeons.  If you want this, use --basicshuffle instead.
#
# - If run in the command line as "python Main.py --basicshuffle", each
#   track is chosen from the same track from a random pack.  If you have any
#   extended packs, the dungeon/boss themes from non-extended packs will
#   never be chosen.
#
# - If run in the command line as "python Main.py --fullshuffle", behavior
#   for non-looping tracks (short fanfares, portals, etc.) remains as
#   default, but looping tracks will be in shuffled order, so each track
#   in the generated pack is chosen from a random track number in a random
#   MSU pack.  Pick this if you like shop music in Ganon's Tower.
#
# - If run in the command line as
#   "python Main.py --singleshuffle ../your-msu-pack-name-here", behavior is
#   the same as with --fullshuffle, but a single MSU pack of your choice is
#   chosen as the shuffled source for all tracks in the generated pack.
#
# - If run in the command line as "python Main.py --higan" (along with any
#   other options), the shuffled MSU pack is generated in a higan-friendly
#   subdirectory "./higan.sfc/"
#
# - Searches the parent directory of the directory containing the script for
#   all MSU packs to be included in the shuffler by default, but will skip
#   any tracks with "disabled" (case-insensitive) in the directory name or
#   file name; useful for keeping tracks hidden from the shuffler without
#   needing to move them out of the collection entirely.
#
# - Caches the track list in ./trackindex.pkl to avoid reindexing the entire
#   collection every time the script is run.  If run in the command line as
#   "python Main.py --reindex", it will regenerate the track index.  Use this
#   to pick up any new MSU packs for the shuffler.
#
#  Debugging options (not necessary for normal use):
#
# - This script uses hardlinks instead of copies by default to reduce disk
#   usage and increase speed; the --realcopy option can be used to create
#   real copies instead of hardlinks.  Real copies are forced if the shuffled
#   MSU pack and the source MSU packs are on different hard drives.
#
# - The --dry-run option can be used to make this script print the filesystem
#   commands (deleting, creating, renaming files) it would have executed
#   instead of executing them.

#pack will result in no boss/dungeon music from a non-extended pack ever
#being chosen if the user has a single extended pack.
#
#To allow dungeon/boss music to be played, the dungeon/boss-specific
#extended MSU tracks are shuffled differently; for each extended
#dungeon/boss-specific track, a pack is chosen randomly, then its
#corresponding dungeon/boss-specific track is chosen if present,
#otherwise, the generic dungeon/boss music from that pack is chosen.
#
#This means that a user that ONLY has non-extended packs won't be able to
#listen to dungeon music to determine crystal/pendant status in modes where
#that applies (since EP/DP/TH would always play light world music from a
#random pack regardless of pendant/crystal status).  To preserve that
#behavior, --basicshuffle can be used.
